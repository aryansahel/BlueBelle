# Virtual Assistant.py Â©

# This is the code for a simple chatbot/virtual assistant. It is currently capable of:
# 1. Responding to courtesies.
# 2. Displaying the date and time.
# 3. Performing searches on wikipedia

#TODO
# FEAT 1. create bailout function accessible at any time that restarts/accelerates bot
#      2. automatically determine if text or speech input is to be taken
#      3. simplify/combine else and exceptions in main while loop




# THINGS TO ADD:
# 1. Ability to send texts
# 2. Ability to dial a number

# Bug fixes
# To remove "no parser explicitly specified" warning
# Find similar path to C:\Users\Ethan\PycharmProjects\assistant\venv\Lib\site-packages\wikipedia
# Replace lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')
# With lis = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser").find_all('li')
#
# To get proper wikipedia search ie not getting "honey" when searching "donkey"
# Replace result = wikipedia.summary(search, sentences)
# With result = wikipedia.summary(search, sentences, auto_suggest=False)
