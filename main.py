# START OF CODE
# Written by Aryan Sahel and Ethan Clarke:) last updated August 20, 2020.
# Virtual Assistant.py Â©

# This is the code for a simple chatbot/virtual assistant. It is currently capable of:
# 1. Responding to courtesies.
# 2. Displaying the date and time.
# 3. Performing searches on wikipedia

#TODO
# BUGS 1. if timer ends while bot is already speaking an error occurs
#      2. searching "donkey" returns "honey" from wikipedia, is there a way to double check/stop this error
# FEAT 1. create bailout function accessible at any time that restarts/accelerates bot
#      2. simplify exceptions in main try/excpetion thingy so we don't need an else statement
#      3. automatically determine if text or speech input is to be taken




# THINGS TO ADD:
# 1. Ability to send texts
# 2. Ability to dial a number
# 3. Ability to set a timer/alarm

# To remove "no parser explicitly specified" warning
# Find similar path to C:\Users\Ethan\PycharmProjects\assistant\venv\Lib\site-packages\wikipedia
# Repalce lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')
# With lis = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser").find_all('li')
